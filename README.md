# Windows Command Line Obfuscation

## Background
`analyse_obfuscation` is a python3 module for finding commmon command-line obfuscation techniques for any given program, as described in [this](https://wietze.github.io/blog/windows-command-line-obfuscation) blog post.

## Usage

### Run
The simplest way to use this project is by running it (without installation).

* **Run script**: clone the entire repository, install all dependencies (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`) and run via:
  ```bash
  python3 -m analyse_obfuscation.run --help
  ```

### Install
By installing the project, it will be possible to simply call `analyse_obfuscation` from the command line.
* **Via PyPI**: install the application via for example pip:
  ```bash
  pip3 install analyse_obfuscation
  ```
* **From source**: you can install a local version of the module by cloning the entire repository, followed by these commands:
  (note that this requires `setuptools` to be installed)
  ```bash
  python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  pip3 install dist/analyse_obfuscation-*-py3-none-any.whl --upgrade
  ```

## Examples
```bash
# Check simple 'ping' command
analyse_obfuscation --command "ping /n 1 localhost"

# Check 'net share' command using {random}, which will be replaced by random string for each execution
analyse_obfuscation --command "net share x=c:\\ /remark:{random}"

# Check 'powershell /encodedcommand' command with increased timeout, as executions tend to take long
analyse_obfuscation --command "powershell /encodedcommand ZQBjAGgAbwAgACIAQAB3AGkAZQB0AHoAZQAiAA==" --timeout 5

# Check 'systeminfo' command by only looking at the exit code, not the output - since every output will be different due to (changing) timestamps
analyse_obfuscation --command "systeminfo /s localhost" --exit_code_only

# Check all commands as specified in sample.json, saving all reports in 'reports/'
analyse_obfuscation --json_file sample/sample.json --report_dir reports/
```

Sample report files generated by the above commands can be found in the [sample_output/](sample_outputs/) folder.

## All options
All command-line options of this project can be requested by using the `--help` option:

```
usage: analyse_obfuscation [--threads n] [--verbose] [--report_dir c:\path\to\dir] [--log_file c:\path\to\file.log] [--help] [--command "proc /arg1 /arg2"] [--range {full,educated,ascii,custom}] [--custom_range 0x??..0x?? [0x??..0x?? ...]] [--char_offset n] [--post_command process_name] [--exit_code_only] [--timeout n] [--json_file c:\path\to\file.jsonl]

Tool for identifying executables that have command-line options that can be obfuscated.

required arguments (either is required):
  --command "proc /arg1 /arg2"
                        Single command to test
  --json_file c:\path\to\file.jsonl
                        Path to JSON file (JSON Line formatted) containing commands config

optional --command arguments:
  --range {full,educated,ascii,custom}
                        Character range to scan (default=educated)
  --custom_range 0x??..0x?? [0x??..0x?? ...]
                        Range to scan
  --char_offset n       Character position used for insertion and replacement
  --post_command process_name
                        Command to run unconditionally after each attempt (e.g. to clean up)
  --exit_code_only      Only base success on the exit code (and not the output of the command)
  --timeout n           Number of seconds per execution before timing out.

optional arguments:
  --threads n           Number of threads to use
  --verbose             Increase output verbosity
  --report_dir c:\path\to\dir
                        Path to save report files to
  --log_file c:\path\to\file.log
                        Path to save log to
  --help                Show this help message and exit
```
